# Strategy Design Pattern

## Definition  
The **Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms (strategies), encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.  
It lets the algorithm vary **independently** from the clients that use it.

> In simple terms: Replace `if-else` with reusable and switchable logic objects.

- Avoids duplicate logic in child classes  
- Promotes **Open/Closed Principle**  
- Enables behavior change at runtime  
- Improves **modularity**, **testability**, and **maintainability**
